Here we publish the translated version of the survey questions used for our data collection (the original survey was conducted in Chinese). The attention check question was removed from the original survey. Also, the constructs (question categories) shown here are for information purposes only. The original survey did not include the constructs or categories to prevent any bias it may introduce.
